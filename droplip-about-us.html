								<h2>GET TO KNOW US!</h2>
								<span class="byline">Why we started droplip</span>
							</header>
							<p><strong>DROPLIP was founded by Devasree and Sherlene in 2023.</strong></p>
							<img src="images/IMG_5349.jpg" alt="Founders Devasree and Lin" style="float: left; width: 90%; max-width: 350px; margin-right: 10px;">
							<p>United by a passion for sustainability and beauty, we wanted to address the environmental
								challenges while incoporating the ever-growing beauty industry. Disturbed by the excessive
								use of harmful chemicals and non-biodegradable packaging, we envisioned a cosmetic brand
								that would redefine beauty without compromising the planet.</p>
							<p>In our pursuit, we meticulously curated biodegradable lipsticks that marries the allure of
								beauty with the responsibility of sustainability. We delved into the realms of cruelty-free
								practices and sought out natural, organic ingredients, ensuring that every product not only
								enhances your beauty but also respects the delicate balance of our environment.</p>
							<p>Our commitment extends beyond the product formulation; we're on a mission to revolutionise
								packaging. Exploring innovative, eco-friendly materials, we aim to minimise waste and
								contribute to a circular economy. We believe that beauty shouldn't come at the expense of
								the planet, and every step we take is geared towards proving that sustainable practices can
								seamlessly coexist with glamour.</p>
							<p>As our cosmetic brand gains momentum, we find fulfilment in the growing community that shares
								our values. It's not just about creating products; it's about fostering a movement where
								beauty becomes synonymous with ethical choices and environmental stewardship. Join us in
								redefining beauty â€“ where every application is a testament to a commitment to both yourself
								and the planet. Together, let's paint a picture of beauty that leaves a lasting, positive
								impact.</p>

								<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
							</header>
							<p>It all starts with a lipstick. Our DROPLIPs are clear lipsticks that swatches with colours
								that forms right from your skin's pH level! Our clear lippies allow you to see a sneak of
								what seed your lipstick has! Plant seeds are embedded in our biodegradable product packaging
								that allows for easy disposal to harvest the growth of your little sapling! <strong>Simply
									use your Droplip to your desire and dispose of it on any form of soil</strong> (yes even
								the grass outside!) and with sufficient water and sunlight, <strong>your lippie will turn
									into a plant that contributes to more greenery around us.</strong> Meaning fresher air
								and better habitats for insect and animal species to live! </p>
